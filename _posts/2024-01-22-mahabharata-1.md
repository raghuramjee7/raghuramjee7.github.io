# Aswathama hatha, iti narova kunjarova

The time when Dharmaraja lied.  

During the Kurukshetra, Dronacharya was leading the Kaurava Army, and he is a the sage who can not be defeated, not while he is still holding his weapons. For Dharma to win, Krishna had to come up with a plan to kill Dronacharya.  

Krishna knew that Dronacharya loved his son, Ashwathama, more than anything in the world, and the only thing that could make Dronacharya drop his weapons could be the news of his son's death, and that news can be truthful or false.

When Krishna told his plan to Dharmaraja, he did not want to lie, he did not want to decieve his guru, but Dharma had to win, and what needs to be done, needs to be done.  

Bhima has killed the elephant named Aswathama, and announced that Aswathama is dead. Dronacharya asked Dharmaraja if the news was true, if Aswathama was really dead, because he could only believe the words of Dharmaraja, the man who is truthful and virtuous.  

Upon hearing Dronacharya's question, Yudhisthir said **"Aswathama hatha, iti narova kunjarova"** (Ashwathama is dead, and murmured, I dont know if it is a man or elephant). This broke the heart of Dronacharya, who dropped his weapons, and was killed by Dhristadyumna.  

Dharmaraja, the epitome of Dharma, had to lie, because at the end, Dharma had to win, no matter the cost, no matter the means.  

In this way, sometimes we need to do things that we dont want to do, but we have to do, because it is the right thing to do, and we do them for Dharma, not for personal gain, not for personal glory, but for the greater good.
