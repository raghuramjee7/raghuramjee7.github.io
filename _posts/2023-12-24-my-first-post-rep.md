### Welcome

This is my first blog post with jekyll.

#### Why am I doing this?
I really have no idea

#### Why did i choose jekyll?
I wanted to try it with hugo first, but it required creating a git submodule, and I was using codespaces so that i dont have to install hugo, but commiting to a submodule through codespace was not working. It was an issue (feature?) from codespaces to only commit to the repo you built the codespace from. There were some workarounds, but nothing seemed to work for me, so i quit hugo

#### What did i do?
I added minimal theme to _config, the rest i just pulled from minimal repo to adjust as much as i could. this is not the best thing in the world, but i am not complaining.

#### Anything about me?
Idk, ill let you know

##### BIG BIG THANKS TO GITHUB - FOR CODESPACES, PAGES AND GITHUB STUDENT DEVELOPER PACK, WHICH IS SOOO COOL.
